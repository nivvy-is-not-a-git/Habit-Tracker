# PAWGRESS ðŸ§¸ 

This app allows users to enter activities that are in line with the habits they want to achieve or want to remove. Then, it is treated as a to-do list for the user to accomplish throughout the day. What differentiates us from any normal to-do list is that our AI technology can analyze the user's habits, differentiate between good and bad routines, and then provide personalized recommendations to achieve those goals. Along with the technical usability, we decided to gamify the app. With our dynamic progress bar, users not only track their progress but also get to see their fun animated dog avatar evolve as they achieve their goals. It's habit-building made interactive and rewarding.
